One of the most friendly[a] things about graduating is that my friends[n] are planning[v] a huge partty. i decided to have a backyard barbecue for all of my family and friends[n]. i have invited[v] my best frind sarah[n] and of course my techer Mrs nesrin[n]. My dad is going to prepare[v] hamburgers and meat on his shiny new gril[n]. He always thinks his hamburger taste really spicy[a],but i think they taste like salty[a]
